**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** \
The most interesting topic covered in this domain is how a currency can be securely decentralized in a public network using cryptology.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** \
One potential investigation I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 Project is how to reduce malicious actors wanting to abuse the payment system by purposefully locking all funds at the cost of their funds in order to see the other user lose their funds as well.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** \
A potential change I would like to make in my approach to the Quarter 1 Project is trying to implement more complex smart contracts.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?** \
One technique I would be interested in using in the project is testing smart contracts in a local fork of the Ethereum blockchain before testing them in a testnet Ethereum blockchain. Another technique I would be interested in using is natural language processing to handle search queries in the test e-commerce platform.
